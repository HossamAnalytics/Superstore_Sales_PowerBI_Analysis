### 💡 Key Business Insights

1.  **Profitability Anomaly:** Identified that the 'West' region, while having the highest sales volume, maintains a lower overall profit margin (10% vs. the average 14%) due to aggressive discounting in the 'Technology' category, suggesting a need for pricing optimization.
2.  **Product Underperformance:** Discovered a critical underperformance in the 'Furniture' category in the 'Central' region, which consistently yielded negative profits, requiring immediate investigation into inventory costs and supplier agreements.
3.  **Customer Value:** Analyzed customer segmentation and found that 'Corporate' customers generate the highest average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), recommending an increased focus on B2B sales strategies.
